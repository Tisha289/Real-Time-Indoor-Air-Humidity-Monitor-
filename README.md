# Real-Time-Indoor-Air-Humidity-Monitor-
Designed and developed a line follower robot as part of a team project using Arduino Uno, IR sensors, and an 
L298N motor driver. 
• Programmed the robot to detect and follow a black line path using real-time feedback from sensor inputs. 
Implemented control logic for forward motion, turning, and recovery from path deviations. 
• Gained hands-on experience in embedded C/C++ programming, sensor calibration, motor control, and hardware 
integration. 
• Strengthened skills in automation, real-time decision-making, and collaborative electronics development.
